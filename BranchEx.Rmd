## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r ceDat}
datapath <- "/Users/teagueomara/Library/CloudStorage/Box-Box/- Missions & Programs/Collaborative Projects/conservation_evidence/Bio Cons SI Shortfalls Cons Sci/data and script/"

cons_evidence <- read.csv(paste0(datapath,"ConservationEvidence.csv"))%>%
  mutate(Outcome = fct_relevel(Outcome, "Beneficial",
                               "Likely beneficial", "Limited evidence", 
                               "Trade-off ", "Unlikely beneficial", "Likely harmful", "No evidence"),
         IUCN_threat = fct_relevel(IUCN_threat, "Logging & plant harvesting",
                                   "Agriculture", "Hunting & harvesting", 
                                   "Human disturbance", "Urban development", "Energy prod. & mining", 
                                   "Climate change ", "Natural sys. modifications","White-nose Syndrome", "Invasive sp","Diseases",
                                   "Light pollution", "Water pollution", "Noise pollution", "Transportation & corridors", "Multiple threats"))

foraging_ev<- cons_evidence %>% 
  filter(Threat_Response == "Foraging habitat")

foraging_ev %>% select(-Threat_Response) %>%  
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 12)
```


There is a limited amount of git interaction that can be done through the RStudio interface, and it will focus on the main branch on GitHub. If you want to create a new branch to be able to monkey around with things without breaking the `main` code, you can create a separate `branch` and then eventually merge that back to `main`.

Brief list of git commands: https://happygitwithr.com/git-commands.html

Create a branch: 
`git branch testBranch` This will create a branch
`git checkout newBranch` This will switch to that branch and then send your committed work that way.
